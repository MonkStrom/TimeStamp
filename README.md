# TimeStamp

Time Stamp is a mini-project I started during the Summer of 2016.

Bothered by the sounds of many, many planes, I considered making a spreadsheet to track each time I
heard a plane. While that never happened, I made this in case I ever wanted to.

### Current Functionality
- Stamp data to table

- Stamp date, time, and time since last stamp

- Each stamp comes numbered

- Can table export to CSV
